# ResNet-and-VGG19-Flower-dataset
 
 
This classification algorithm is a supervised learning method and requires a labeled dataset. This component does not support tagged dataset created from Data Labeling in studio, only tagged image index created from Convert to Image Index component.


It is a deep learning model that consists of 5 commoning layers and 16 convolution layers ending in 3 fully connected layers and is defined by ReLU activation functions.

I imported the dataset inside thanks to dataset_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz"
